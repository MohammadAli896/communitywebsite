			<p class="text">Green Acres Mall is an indoor shopping mall located in Valley Stream, New York, off Sunrise Highway in Nassau County near the border of New York City and the Incorporated Village of Valley Stream. The mall is the 15th largest in the United States. The mall is extremely popular in Nassau County and in the neighboring New York City borough of Queens. The mall is accessible by many Nassau Inter-County Express routes as well as two MTA New York City Bus routes, the Q5 and Q85, that cross the city border. The mall's anchors are JCPenney, Sears, and two Macy's locations. It has all the large brand stores you could need, from clothing to food and house needs. Middle of the range, not too fancy, mall.</p>

			<p class="text">The sound quality is excellent, the seats fully recline, and the theater is nice and clean. Plenty of space in your seats, which are super comfy and can lean back. The bar has pretty reasonable prices and it's definitely a great option to accompany an evening movie. The staff are always friendly and helpful during visits. The parking can sometimes be a bit inconvenient but the prices arent bad for what you get here.</p>
